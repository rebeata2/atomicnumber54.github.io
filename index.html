<h1>All About Me!</h1>
<h3>A Comprehensive Guide to Harshvardhan Nair</h3>

<p>So, you stumbled across this website and you don't know who the heck I am, or you're a friend of mine or related to me and I told you about this site. Either way, I'll be using this site to tell you all about me. </p>

<h2>Aliases</h2>
<p>I have multiple names. No, not cover-up names; I'm not a criminal. What I mean is nicknames. You see, I'm known as Xenon, Xomnion, and most people know me as HarshManThanos. Well, most people actually know me as Harshvardhan Nair, but you know what I mean. Now, why do I have these aliases, and why are they called that? Well, I didn't really like putting my full name on the Internet as my gaming channel (I regrettedly deleted my gaming videos instead of privating them), so I decided to look for some names. I saw a video guide on how to name my Youtube channel, and it said that I should give out a few abstract names a try. "X is a cool letter," I thought. "Xolnin, Xuxo, Xiaomi, Xomnion... wait. Xomnion is a perfect name!" So I decided to name my gaming channel Xomnion. But, to be honest, Xolnin could've been an AWESOME name.</p> <br> <img src="https://yt3.googleusercontent.com/XLJKXnH6STF2PVckDUqmRJ5gp_guvD-XQHWE2Vt9VTzrtvynWSzQsHlPl1g-k4B89uBtghCZr60=s240-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj" alt="Xomnion Profile Picture">

<p>Now, let's discover; why did I go for Xenon next? Well, after a year of Xomnion, I heard the word coming out of my mouth, and thought it sounded awesome!.. again. So naturally I looked it up to see if anyone else thought of the name. Well, would you look at that. It's an atomic element. Now my favorite. Fun fact: xenon actually caused a huge role in the Chernobyl incident due to xenon poisoning in the reactor. Not me, the element. Gosh. </p>
